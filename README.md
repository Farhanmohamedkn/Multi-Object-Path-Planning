## Introduction

Path planning is a fundamental problem in robotics and artificial intelligence, where the objective is to find a collision-free path from a starting point to a goal point. Two common algorithms used for path planning are Direct A* and Velocity A*.

In this project, we explore the performance of these algorithms on grid maps of varying sizes (10x10, 20x20, 30x30) and obstacle coverages (low, medium, high).

## Data

The data used for the comparison consists of IPYNB files containing implementations of Direct A* and Velocity A* algorithms. Each IPYNB file contains the following:
- Grid maps of sizes 10x10, 20x20, and 30x30.
- Obstacle coverages: low, medium, and high.
- Path plots for each algorithm on each map.
- Computation times for each algorithm on each map.

## Results

The results of the comparison are summarized as follows:
- Direct A* and Velocity A* paths plotted separately for each map.
- Computation times tabulated and graphed for each algorithm on each map.

For detailed results and visualizations, refer to the IPYNB files in the repository.
